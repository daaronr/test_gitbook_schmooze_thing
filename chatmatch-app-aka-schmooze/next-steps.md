# Next steps

&#x20;_**For a fully functional app, you would need to expand this example to include**_ user registration, authentication, a database, and other features outlined in the summary and suggested approach.

### Next Steps

To turn the minimal working example into a fully functional ChatMatch app, you should consider the following steps:

1. **User registration and authentication**: Implement a registration and login system using Passport.js or another authentication library. This will allow users to create accounts and securely sign in to access the app's features.
2. **User profile creation and management**: Create a user profile system that allows users to enter their personal information, interests, and preferences. This will be used to improve chat partner matching.
3. **Database integration**: Choose a database, such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL, to store user data, chat availability statuses, and friendships. Connect the database to the backend server, and create the necessary endpoints for accessing and updating data.
4. **Friend management and invitations**: Implement a system that allows users to search for friends, send friend requests, and manage their friend list. Users should be able to invite friends to use the app and view their friends' chat availability statuses.
5. **Matching algorithm**: Develop a matching algorithm that takes into account users' interests, preferences, and availability to find the best possible chat partners. You can start with a simple algorithm that matches users based on shared interests and availability, then refine it over time.
6. **In-app messaging**: Integrate a real-time messaging system, such as Socket.IO, to enable users to send messages and notifications to each other within the app. This will allow users to coordinate calls and discuss shared interests more efficiently.
7. **UI/UX improvements**: Enhance the user interface and user experience by incorporating responsive design, intuitive navigation, and a visually appealing layout.
8. **Testing and deployment**: Thoroughly test the app for functionality, security, and performance. Once the app is stable and fully functional, deploy it to a hosting provider or cloud platform for public access.
