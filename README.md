# Chatmatch app (aka Schmooze)

## ChatMatch App Proposal

### Summary

ChatMatch[^1] is a web app that allows users to find and connect with friends or other users for phone calls or video chats based on shared interests and availability. The key features of the app include:

1. User registration and login system
2. User profile creation and management
3. Chat availability status updates
4. Friend management and invitations
5. Matching algorithm to find suitable chat partners
6. In-app messaging system to coordinate calls

### Suggested Approach

The technology stack for the ChatMatch app should include:

1. **Frontend**: React or Angular for building a responsive and dynamic user interface.
2. **Backend**: Node.js with Express for building the server-side logic and RESTful API.
3. **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing user data, chat availability statuses, and friendships.
4. **Authentication**: Passport.js for handling user authentication and authorization.
5. **Real-time communication**: Socket.IO for enabling real-time messaging and notifications.
